Autorenamer uses inotify to change when a file is created. The time of creation is appended on to the file's name. This makes it easy to discern when the file was downloaded.

"Modified on" and "Accessed on" simply aren't reliable for discerning when a file was introduced to a file system.

At this time I am the sole developer on this project, and will keep it that way until the project matures. Therefore, this project is not open source. Nor am I granting any license to use it.

Once I'm ready to distribute this project, or collaborate in it's development, I'll license it.

I'm currently  discerning the limitations of various downloaders.
